# traffic-sign-alert-system

This is a simple traffic sign recognition and alert system, which uses CNN to recognise the traffic signs and uses simple supervised learning approach,with the help of the well developed GTSRB for dataset. I have referred to various sites for this project, and added the feature of the audio to the recognised signs. The model is pickled in order to ensure a faster execution of the model and improved portability.
